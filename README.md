# GeoSphere Challenge

An immersive, futuristic geography guessing game built with Google Street View and Maps.

## Quick status

- Status: Active development (WIP)
- Planned release: Upcoming (subscribe / watch the repo for updates)

## What changed (this README)

This README was rewritten to include the current file structure, setup instructions, and developer notes. It also adds a friendly development banner at the top to let visitors know the project is not yet a polished public release.

## Project overview

GeoSphere Challenge drops players into a random Google Street View location somewhere on Earth. Players must guess the location on an interactive world map. Rounds are scored by geographic distance (Haversine) and time-based bonuses. The UI uses a neon-glass aesthetic with animated reveal effects.

## Repository structure

Top-level files:

- `index.html` â€” main app HTML (loads Street View and map panes)
- `style.css` â€” global styles and neon/aurora theming
- `script.js` â€” game logic, scoring, and UI glue code
- `mapHandler.js` â€” map initialization and guess handling
- `streetviewHandler.js` â€” Street View loading and camera control
- `config.js` â€” add your Google Maps API key here (not committed)
- `README.md` â€” this file

Assets folder:

- `assets/`
  - `bg/` â€” background images and videos (aurora, stars, etc.)
    - `aurora.png` (or `aurora.mp4` if using video background)
    - `stars.png`
  - `icons/` â€” map pins and UI icons
    - `pin-actual.png`
    - `pin-guess.png`
    - `neon-globe.svg` (optional)
  - `sounds/` â€” short sound effects
    - `correct.mp3`
    - `wrong.mp3`

## Features

- Random global Street View location selection with graceful retry if imagery isn't available
- Dual pane UI: a Street View pane and an interactive world map for guessing
- Scoring uses Haversine distance and a time bonus for faster guesses
- Neon-glass UI with aurora/stars background and subtle particle effects
- Animated reveal sequence: pins, amber beam, and auto-zoom to the correct location
- 5-round game with summary and share options

## Setup (developer)

1. Create a Google Cloud project and enable the following APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Street View Static/Service (if applicable)

2. Add your API key to `config.js` in the project root. Example `config.js`:

```js
// config.js (do not commit your real key)
const CONFIG = {
  GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
};

export default CONFIG;
```

3. Run a local static server to serve the files. Example (requires Node.js):

```powershell
npx serve .
```

Open the printed URL in your browser (commonly http://localhost:3000).

Notes on security: restrict your API key to the specific domain(s) or local development origin in the Google Cloud Console.

## Local development tips

- Use the browser devtools to inspect console logs for Street View load errors (imagery missing, quota issues).
- If Street View imagery isn't available for a selected location the game retries with a new random point.
- To speed up styling edits, use a live-reload server or browser extension.

## Deployment

- This project is suitable for static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel). Ensure your API key restrictions allow the hosted domain.
- For GitHub Pages: push to the `main` branch and enable Pages in repository settings.

## Contributing

- Issues and pull requests are welcome. Label changes or big UI rewrites as "WIP" until stable.
- Please do not commit API keys. Use `config.js` locally and add a note in `.gitignore` if you create a file with secrets.

## File checklist (recommended additions)

- Add or confirm these assets exist in `assets/`:
  - `assets/icons/pin-guess.png`
  - `assets/icons/pin-actual.png`
  - `assets/icons/neon-globe.svg`
  - `assets/bg/aurora.mp4` or `assets/bg/aurora.png`
  - `assets/bg/stars.webp` or `assets/bg/stars.png`
  - `assets/sounds/correct.mp3`
  - `assets/sounds/wrong.mp3`

## Notes for maintainers

- Movement in Street View is disabled by default for fairness (`clickToGo=false` and `linksControl=false`), so tests and UI rely on the fixed camera.
- Scoring thresholds live in `script.js` â€” tweak to balance difficulty and scoring fairness.
